My main area of interest is the development of new applications and ways of using variational methods. In particular, I like to use them in a way that allows me to impose certain conditions on the latent space in these systems. These conditions allow me to solve different tasks. To test the performance of these systems, I try to solve tasks related to audio and image processing.

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD under the direction of Dr. Alfonso Ortega and Dr. Luis Vicente at the University of Zaragoza. Previously, I received the Bachelor degree in Telecommunication Engineering and the Master degree in Modeling, Mathematical Research, Statistics and Computing from the University of Zaragoza, Spain in the years 2020 and 2021 respectively.
