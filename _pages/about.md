My research centers on the use of Information Theory to model representation spaces subject to specific, application-dependent conditions. By optimizing information-theoretic quantities, I design representations that are mathematically robust and tailored to complex requirements. These techniques have proven successful in a variety of tasks, including multimodal alignment, disentanglement, and machine unlearning.

I am currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Zaragoza (Spain) under the supervision of Dr. Alfonso Ortega. Prior to this, I earned my Master’s in Modeling, Mathematical Research, Statistics, and Computing and my Bachelor’s in Telecommunication Engineering from the same institution, which included a six-month exchange program at Chalmers University (Sweden).

I have also served as a visiting researcher at several institutions, including Johns Hopkins University (USA), the University of Cambridge (UK), INRIA and Le Mans Université (France), and Brno University of Technology (Czech Republic).
