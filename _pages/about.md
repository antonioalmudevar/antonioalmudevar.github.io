My research centers on the use of Information Theory to model representation spaces subject to specific, application-dependent conditions. By optimizing information-theoretic quantities, I design representations that are mathematically robust and tailored to complex requirements. These techniques have proven successful in a variety of tasks, including multimodal alignment, disentanglement, and machine unlearning.

I am currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Zaragoza under the supervision of Dr. Alfonso Ortega. Prior to this, I earned my Master’s in Modeling, Mathematical Research, Statistics, and Computing (2021) and my Bachelor’s in Telecommunication Engineering (2020) from the same institution, which included a six-month exchange program at Chalmers University.

To validate and expand my research, I have collaborated with international teams as a visiting researcher at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Cambridge, INRIA, Le Mans Université, and Brno University of Technology.
