  abstract={Distributed acoustic sensors (DASs) based on direct-detection Φ-OTDR use the light–matter interaction between light pulses and optical fiber to detect mechanical events in the fiber environment. The signals received in Φ-OTDR come from the coherent interference of the portion of the fiber illuminated by the light pulse. Its high sensitivity to minute phase changes in the fiber results in a severe reduction in the signal to noise ratio in the intensity trace that demands processing techniques be able to isolate events. For this purpose, this paper proposes a method based on Unsupervised Anomaly Detection techniques which make use of concepts from the field of deep learning and allow the removal of much of the noise from the Φ-OTDR signals. The fact that this method is unsupervised means that no human-labeled data are needed for training and only event-free data are used for this purpose. Moreover, this method has been implemented and its performance has been tested with real data showing promising results.},

    abstract = "Anomalous sound detection (ASD) is the task of identifying if a sound is normal or anomalous with respect to a given reference. In most scenarios, we have a large amount of normal data to design our model, but little or no anomalous data. When this situation occurs, the problem can be approached in an unsupervised manner, i.e., only normal data is used for design. In this report we present a solution for the DCASE2022 task 2 (Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection for Machine Condition Monitoring Applying Domain Generalization Techniques), which aims to address the ASD problem under domain generalization. This means that the data to develop the system belongs to the source domain, while the test data can belong to this domain or to a different one (target domain). The presented solution proposes an embeddings extractor based on a Vision Transformer (ViT) and makes use of the k-Nearest-Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to obtain the anomaly score.",

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
